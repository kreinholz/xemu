Getting Started:
- xemu is a low-level, full-system emulator which emulates the actual hardware
  of the Xbox; this means that in order to actually run xemu, you must have a
  copy of the stuff that a real Xbox needs when it turns on:
  - MCPX Boot ROM Image
  - Flash ROM Image (BIOS)
  - Hard Disk Image
- Please visit https://xemu.app/docs/required-files/ for more information.
